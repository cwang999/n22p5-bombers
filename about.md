# About

## Project Theme

Welcome to the n22p5-coders! Our idea is to create a website for Del Norte track. It will have a sign up page allowing people interested in track to sign up, as well as a schedule page and a page showing individuals' statistics. 

## Sassy / Bootstrap

- Our website uses both sassy and bootstrap, sassy in the form of .scss files located within our program that makes the theme consistent throughout, using {{ blocks }} to distribute the .scss layout to each page. For bootstrap, it comes in the form of containers and buttons that make many of our features somewhat visually appealing, although we haven't had the opportunity to add it to every single page. The majority of our projects use it though.
